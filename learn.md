* To utilize a prepared statement properly for preventing SQL injection, you need to use placeholders (?) in the SQL query and bind the parameter separately.

```
$stmt = $conn->prepare("INSERT INTO `text_content`(`content`) VALUES (?)");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $content);
```
-------------------------
Using placeholders (`?`) in prepared statements is a best practice for several reasons:

1. **Security against SQL Injection:** When you directly insert variables into SQL queries, it's possible for malicious users to manipulate input data to execute unintended SQL commands. Placeholders separate the SQL query structure from the data, preventing most types of SQL injection attacks by treating the data as parameters rather than executable SQL code.

2. **Performance:** Prepared statements can be precompiled by the database server, potentially improving performance for queries that are used repeatedly with different data.

3. **Data Type Handling:** Placeholders allow the database driver to handle different data types appropriately. This helps in ensuring that the data is interpreted and stored correctly in the database.

By using placeholders and binding parameters with prepared statements, you improve the security and robustness of your application against potential attacks and also benefit from some performance enhancements.
